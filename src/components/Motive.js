                In our circles today, we interact with various people still
                pursuing their studies but have identified their skills and
                talents and continue to work towards bettering themselves.
                However, some of these people lack the platform to showcase how
                good they really are and so tend to remain in the background.

                As a team, aimed at helping others make connections to propagate
                themselves, we would like to give such people the platform to
                expose their skills and talents to people who can help them
                advance.
