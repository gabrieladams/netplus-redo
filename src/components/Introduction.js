                NetPlus Kenya is a registered empowerment agency founded by
                Cheryl Okumu and Margaret Lidoro working with a team of fellow
                young people from various career fields brought together by the
                vision projects we have whether structural establishments or new
                trend movements in our respective fieldsâ€™.

                We realize that in order to achieve our vision projects we need
                to establish an array of connections to support us in terms of
                resources. We not only wish to do so for ourselves but also to
                help other youths advance in their respective fields through
                showcasing their skills and talents.
